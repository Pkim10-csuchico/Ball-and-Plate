# Introduction
A ball and plate system is a commenly known example for testing control and artificial intelligence algorithms. Two motors controlling the angle of a plate must adjust the position of the ball in order to keep it balanced. A controller for the ball and plate system will be designed as well as a mathematical model and a simulation using MATLAB and Simulink.
