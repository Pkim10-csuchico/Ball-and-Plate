### I. Introduction
A ball and plate system is an example that allows testing, and control of artificial intelligence algorithms. Two stepper motors controlling the angle of a plate. Each stepper motor will be used for the x axis, and y axis of plate motion. Adjustment of the plate position in order to control ball orientation, keeping it balanced on top of the plate is the goal. A controller for the ball-and-plate system will be designed, mathematical model analysis performed, and a simulation using MATLAB/Simulink for the ball and plate system.
